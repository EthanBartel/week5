Part 1. 
#!/bin/bash

#Week Six homework
#script expects integers in the command line before beginning
n=$1
sum=0
for i in $@
do
	if [[ $i -lt 10 ]]
	then 
		sum=$((sum+$i))
		count=$(($count+1))
	fi
done
echo "The number of integers under ten is $count"
echo "The sum of those numbers is $sum."

# DB: Good! But n isn't used, right?
#     Also, minor, but I had intended that you'd take the sum of all numbers (not just
#     those less than 10).


PART 2: 
#!/bin/bash

#script expects the numbers on different lines

echo "Enter File Name With Extension:"
read file 
echo -n "Integers less than or equal to ten in $file: "
awk '$1<10{c++} END{print c+0}' $file
echo -n "Sum of All Numbers in $file: "
awk '{ sum+=$1} END {print sum}' $file

# DB: Nicely done. Did you know this awk syntax or find it somewhere?


PART 3:
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter File Name With Extension:"
read file
cat $file | awk '{ if(($1>10) && ($2<10)){print}}'
exit

# DB: Also good.
